description: Trains of 4 paired pulses (600 + 600 ns) were applied to BPAE cell monolayers
  at either 1 Hz or 770 kHz, at 10 kV/cm. The electric field direction either stayed
  the same in each pair or was changed by 90Â°. Electroporation efficiency was measured
  by the ptake of YP dye. Supported by NIH 1R21EY034258
