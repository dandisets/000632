description: 'The efficiency of electroporation was evaluated in an experiment involving
  co-directional and cross-directional paired pulses using a triangular electrode
  array. BPAE cell monolayers were exposed to trains of four paired pulses, each consisting
  of 600 + 600 ns, at two distinct frequencies: 1 Hz and 770 kHz, with an amplitude
  of 10 kV/cm. In one scenario, the electric field direction remained consistent throughout
  each pair (co-directional). In another, the field direction was altered by 90° (cross-directional).
  The electroporation efficiency was quantified through the cells’ uptake of YoPro-1
  dye, serving as a measure of the permeabilization of the cell membranes under varying
  electric field orientations and frequencies. Supported by NIH 1R21EY034258
